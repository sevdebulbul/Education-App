## What this mobile app offers?

In this React Native Project I made an education mobile app using React Native, Node.js and MongoDB. This mobile app offers different features such as displaying desired books, searching for specific books, adding new books etc. 

In the backend of this project I used Node.js and MongoDB to create databases and APIs. In the authentication I used Firebase Authentication. 

Due to security reasons, any key used in this project has been changed. For more information on this project, you can contact me.
